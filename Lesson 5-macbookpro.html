    <!-- So if I did not include the <span> in my (buy-button)
      code, then when changing the background color the whole
    line would be highlighted. But with pointing out a specific
    word as in "buy" with span, when changing the background color
    Only the characters in the <span> will change color. Making 
      the shape of a <button> that I can customize -->

    <!-- Secondly when trying to change the margin-top
    of my <span class="buy"> css, it would not let me
      I instead had to make another style set in my css 
    to customize the <p class="buy-button"> in order for 
      the margin-top to take effect. -->
